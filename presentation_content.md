## Slide 2: The Problem

**Title**: The "Bharat" Employability Gap
**Content**:

- **Massive Scale**: India produces millions of graduates annually, but employability remains low (especially in Tier-2/3 cities).
- **The "Soft Skills" Barrier**: Students have technical knowledge but fail interviews due to poor communication and lack of structured thought (e.g., STAR method).
- **Lack of Mentorship**: Rural students rely on generic YouTube videos. They cannot afford expensive bootcamps or 1:1 expert coaching.
- **Impact**: Talented youth remain unemployed or underemployed despite having potential.

    2. **Answer Strategy Guide**: Teaches the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for every question type.
    3. **Vernacular Support**: Explains concepts in Hinglish/native languages to build confidence.
    4. **Adaptive Mock Interviews**: Real-time voice simulations with instant feedback on confidence, pace, and content.

## Slide 4: How It Works (Technology)

**Title**: Powered by AWS & Generative AI
**Content**:

  - **Resume Parsing**: Amazon Textract (Reads PDFs).

  - **App**: React Native / React Web (Amplify).
- **Differentiation**: Unlike simple chatbots, we use a "Coaching Prompt Chain" that evaluates *strategy* (STAR method), not just keywords.
